# Rust Workshop 1

For each of the below, take in a file name (how you do this is your
      choice), and if it doesn't exist, create a bmp. If it does exist but
      isn't a valid BMP, return an error. If it does exist and is a BMP,
      overwrite it."

## Tasks
- [x] Draw a single pixel of any color, anywhere on the image.
- [x] "Draw a diagonal line of any color, across one diagonal of a square
      canvas. Error if the canvas is not square."

- [ ] "Draw the plot of a sine wave that's 20 pixels high, across the center of

- [ ] "For each of the below, take in two files called f1 and f2 (how you do
      this is your choice). If either don't exist or aren't valid, throw an
      error."
- [ ] "If f1 and f2 have the same dimensions; write to f1 a pixel-wise average
      of the two. Otherwise print an appropriate error message."
- [ ] "If f1 and f2 have the same dimensions; print the first row of the first;
      then the second row of the second, then the first row of the third." Copy
      f1 on top of f2. If f1 does not fit inside f2, print an appropriate error
      message
